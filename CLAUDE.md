⛔ NEVER write code, edit files, or run commands without explicitly announcing Code Exception Mode first. This is a learning project — guide, don't implement.

# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this project is

**Ingot** — a high-performance RAW+JPEG photo ingestion and triage engine, intended to be written in **Rust**. It competes with Photo Mechanic / FastRawViewer: ingest a camera card fast, let the photographer rate and cull *immediately* while files replicate to multiple storage targets in the background.

**This is a learning project, not a delivery project.** The point is for the user to learn by implementing it themselves. There is no source code in the repo yet — only the design and the architectural plan. Do not scaffold a Cargo project, write modules, or run build/test commands unless the user explicitly grants a Code Exception (see below).

## Operating mode (governed by the `learning-guide` skill)

The `learning-guide` skill (`.claude/skills/learning-guide/`) is always active for this repo and is the source of truth for *how* to work here. Read it before doing anything substantive. The essentials:

- **Guide, never implement.** Explain *why* at the hardware/systems level (cache lines, device saturation, semaphore tiers, ownership/type-state). Point direction and suggest experiments. Do not produce code.
- **Code Exception Mode** is the *only* way code gets written, and it requires explicit user phrasing ("just write it", "make an exception", "write the code now", "let's implement together"). You must announce you are entering it first. If unsure whether the user wants code, ask — do not write it.
- **Measurement over intuition.** "Which is faster?" is answered by naming the counters to measure, not by guessing.
- Shorthand commands handled by the skill: `--R` (generate reports), `--|` (save session), `--|--` (restore session), `--s` (status), `--v` (finalise phase), `--v--FORCE` (force finalise). Phase status, artifacts, and measured numbers are tracked in a `## Status` section of this file (added once Phase 1 work begins).

## Where things live

- `docs/planning/global-plan.md` — **the architectural plan (v2). Read this first** for the full phase breakdown, data structures, crate choices, and rationale. (Note: the empty `global-plan.md` at repo root is a stray file; the real plan is under `docs/planning/`.)
- `docs/design/` — the UI design. **Rely on the standalone `docs/design/html_Ingot_v2.html`.** The unpacked `docs/design/ingot_v2/` (`.jsx`, `styles.css`, `data.js`, images) is the source bundle — consult it only on the first pass or when you need a specific detail.
- `docs/sessions/phase-N/` and `docs/lessons/phase-N/` — created by the skill as the project progresses (session logs and learning reports). Absent until work starts.

## Architecture invariants (from the plan — preserve these in any guidance)

These are deliberate design decisions, not suggestions. When discussing implementation, hold the user to them:

- **Asset pairing is keyed on `(dir, stem)`, case-normalized — never stem alone.** Canon rolls `IMG_9999 → IMG_0001`, and separate folders/cards reuse names; a flat stem-keyed map silently merges unrelated frames.
- **Zero RAW decoding for previews.** Previews come from the parallel `.JPG` or the JPEG embedded in the RAW — never from decoding RAW pixel data.
- **Copy-verify-then-delete, gated at the type level.** Replication copies and verifies (size + BLAKE3) first. Deletion is a separate user-triggered sweep that is *structurally unable* to run on a source file without a `VerifiedReplica`. Default to trash, not hard delete.
- **Read-once, fan-out copy.** Read each source file once and fan out to all targets; never re-read per target. Write to temp, then atomic-rename.
- **Two semaphore tiers.** Cap source-card *reads* (1–2) separately from per-target *writes*. Concurrency only helps across *distinct physical devices* — saturating one card/disk is a device property, not a thread-count property.
- **Streaming UI.** Each photo streams to the grid the instant it is processed; the UI never waits for a batch. At scale this needs a virtualized grid + LRU texture cache (the 24 GB RGBA problem) and a 1:1 loupe view for focus checking.
- **Ratings → XMP for both files, never EXIF, never pixel rewrites.** There is no standard EXIF rating tag; write `xmp:Rating` sidecars (`Rejected → -1`, else `0..5`) for both the CR2 and the JPEG. Keep stars (0–5) and accept/reject as separate internal concepts.
- **Crate roles are split deliberately:** `kamadak-exif` *reads* dates only (it cannot write or extract full previews); a writer crate (`little_exif`/`img-parts` or `rexiv2`) handles XMP; RAW-only previews would need `rawler`/`rawloader`/`libraw`. Prefer `rusqlite` over `sled`; store preview blobs as files on disk with paths in the DB. Size Rayon pools with `std::thread::available_parallelism()`.

## Two scoping decisions — RESOLVED 2026-06-08

1. **RAW-only frames (no parallel JPEG): IN SCOPE.** A `PhotoAsset` with only a RAW is a first-class asset, never an edge case. Adds a RAW-aware crate (`rawler`/`rawloader` or `libraw`) for full-size embedded-preview extraction in Phase 2.
2. **Source-card deletion: OUT OF SCOPE for v1.** To be exposed later as a separate, explicitly-warned button. The normal delete function never touches the source card — it operates only on *copied targets*, gated on `VerifiedReplica` + rejected-state.

## Status

**Current phase:** Phase 2 — CPU-Bound Processing & Streaming (steps 1–3 ✅: capture-time, IFD1 thumb + composed `make_preview`/`make_thumbnail`, RAW-only IFD0 preview; **step 4 streaming + two-tier concurrency is the last**)

**Last session:** 2026-06-13 — **Engine refactor**: restructured into a Cargo workspace — `crates/ingot_core` (engine lib) + root `ingot` binary package (`/src/main.rs`). Split `lib.rs` into `asset`/`scan`/`metadata`/`preview`/`route`/`engine`/`test_support` modules. Added `Engine` + `EngineConfig` (struct+`Default`, Phase-2-locked values) + `ProcessedPreview`; `scan` wired, `ingest` is the step-4 slot. Tightened visibility, removed `test_thumb/` junk, `.DS_Store` ignored. `cargo test --workspace` 9 green, clippy clean. Then designed step 4 (two-tier pipeline) in guide mode.

**Project layout:** Cargo workspace. `/Cargo.toml` = workspace root **and** the `ingot` binary package; `/src/main.rs` = the app (constructs an `Engine`). `crates/ingot_core/` = the engine library (kept UI-dep-free). Public API: `Engine`/`EngineConfig`/`ProcessedPreview` + `scan_source_dir`/`enrich_assets`/`get_embedded_preview_from_tiff_like`/`build_destination_path` + model types. Run app: `cargo run`; tests: `cargo test --workspace`; benches: `cargo run --release -p ingot_core --example bench_{enrich,preview}`.

### Phase 1 — Asset Pairing & Core Data Structures — ✅ COMPLETE (2026-06-11)

**Learning objectives (met):**
- Why `(dir, stem)` case-normalized is the only safe asset key (filename rollover, multi-folder DCIM, multi-card collisions).
- Modeling RAW/JPEG presence so the empty asset is unrepresentable, with RAW-only as a first-class asset.
- A pure, I/O-free date-based ISO routing function.

**Artifacts:**
- `src/lib.rs` — asset model + scanner + routing. Public API: `scan_source_dir -> ScanResponse { assets, collisions, errors }`; `build_destination_path(&Target, NaiveDate, &Path) -> Option<PathBuf>`; types `FileKind`, `AssetKey {dir, stem}`, `AssetFiles` (non-empty, `new`/`insert`/`get`), `PhotoAsset`, `TriageState`, `Collision`, `Target`/`TargetKind`.
- `docs/sessions/phase-1/main-session.md` — session log (3 sessions).
- Deps: `walkdir`, `chrono`; dev: `tempfile`. On-disk fixture `photodata/testing/source/` retained but tests use programmatic tempdir fixtures.

**Key numbers (measured):** assets 11 (7 paired / 2 RAW-only / 2 JPEG-only) ✓ | same-kind collisions surfaced 1 ✓ | routing path exact-match ✓ | `cargo test` **3 passing** | `cargo clippy` clean | naive stem-key counterfactual = 8 (cross-folder dups proven distinct, 11≠8).

**Lessons:**
- The asset *identity* is fully recoverable from the path (`(dir, stem)`), case-normalized — no need to read file contents; a timestamp key is both unavailable at scan time and non-unique (1s EXIF resolution merges bursts).
- Making illegal states unrepresentable (non-empty `AssetFiles`, no `Default`; `_opt` date constructor) beats runtime validation, and is consistent with Phase 3's planned `VerifiedReplica`.
- Batch anomalies (duplicate-kind collisions, walkdir errors) are *data to collect and return*, not errors that abort the scan — one bad frame must never kill a 10k-card ingest.
- Pure functions (`build_destination_path`) decouple cleanly: take the date as a param now, let Phase 2 supply `DateTimeOriginal`.

**Known open items carried forward:**
- `expect("path stem error")` on `file_stem()` is the lone remaining panic in the scan path (defensible; could route to `errors` for full resilience).
- `AssetFiles` backed by `Vec` linear scan — fine at current N; interface (`get`/`insert`) hides it so it stays swappable/measurable.

---

### Phase 2 — CPU-Bound Processing & Streaming (in progress)

Per `docs/planning/global-plan.md`: read `DateTimeOriginal` with `kamadak-exif` (read-only, date-only) to populate `PhotoAsset.captured_at` (feeds `build_destination_path`); decode parallel `.JPG` / extract full-size embedded preview for RAW-only (needs `rawler`/`rawloader` or `libraw`, per resolved scoping decision #1); downsample to ~1920px **compressed JPEG bytes in memory**; stream processed assets to the UI over an mpsc/crossbeam channel.

#### Step 1 — capture-time enrichment — ✅ DONE (2026-06-11)

**Artifacts:**
- `src/lib.rs` — `captured_at: Option<NaiveDateTime>`; `read_capture_time(&PhotoAsset) -> Option<NaiveDateTime>` (private, JPEG-preferred/RAW-fallback, all-`?`/`.ok()?` failure funnel); `enrich_captured_at(&mut HashMap<…>)` (public, compute-then-apply, **serial**).
- `examples/bench_enrich.rs` — release-only timing harness (scan + 3× enrich, cold run 1 / warm 2–3, frames/s).
- `testdata/test_exif_read/` — real-EXIF fixture (incl. a CR2-only frame exercising the RAW fallback).
- Deps: `kamadak-exif` (imports as `exif`). `rayon` present but unused (reserved for step 2).
- `docs/sessions/phase-2/main-session.md` — session log.

**Key numbers (measured, 879-asset Canon set; cold = first read):**
- SD card (USB): serial cold **4.85 s** (181 fps) vs parallel cold **6.20 s** (142 fps) → parallel **−28%, hurts**.
- SSD (`GenericSSD`): serial cold **0.61 s** (1432 fps) vs parallel cold **0.17 s** (5256 fps) → parallel **+3.7×, helps**.
- Cold/warm gap: SD ≈120×, SSD ≈13×. 879/879 parsed, 0 collisions/errors. `cargo test` **5 passing** · clippy clean.
- **Lesson:** optimal source-read concurrency is a *device property*, not a constant — empirical proof of the plan's source-read semaphore tier. Default serial (1–2 permits) for cards; higher for SSD/NVMe. Hardcoding either way is wrong. File I/O concurrency = bounded threads (files don't fit kqueue readiness; io_uring is Linux-only).

**Known open items from step 1:**
- `SubSecTimeOriginal` deliberately deferred (its only consumer, burst-grouping, doesn't exist yet).
- Enrichment kept serial as the default; making read-concurrency a device-tuned permit count is Phase 3 semaphore-tier work.
- Undated frames (`captured_at == None`) not yet routed — routing fallback (mtime? `unsorted/`?) still open.

#### Step 2 — previews (in progress)

Two compressed-JPEG outputs per asset, streamed (not stored on `PhotoAsset`): free embedded **160×120 thumb** (always-in-RAM placeholder) + generated **~1920px preview**. Message: `ProcessedPreview { key, thumb_jpeg, preview_jpeg }`.

**CPU core — ✅ DONE (2026-06-12):**
- `src/preview.rs` — `turbojpeg` scaled-decode → `fast_image_resize` (Lanczos3 → 1920) → `turbojpeg` encode. Currently split (`preview_from_jpeg_bytes`/`resize`/`compress`); to be composed into `make_preview(&[u8]) -> Option<Vec<u8>>` + `pick_scale`.
- `examples/bench_preview.rs` — parallel timing harness (999× one in-RAM JPEG, thread + scaling-factor sweeps).
- Deps: `turbojpeg` (libjpeg-turbo). `fast_image_resize`.
- **Numbers (i7-1068NG7, 4 phys / 8 logical):** parallel scaling **4.26×** (1→8 threads: 100.5→23.5 s; near-linear to 4 physical, HT ~6%) — **inverse of step 1's I/O-bound result**. Scaled decode 1/1→3/8 = **2.7×** (decode dominates; resize self-funding). Embedded (exiftool): CR2 IFD0 = full-res 6240×4160 JPEG, IFD1 = 160×120 ~13 KB; **no mid-size embedded** → grid preview must be generated.
- **Locked:** decode **3/8** (smallest downscale-only; 1/4 upscales, rejected) · **Lanczos3** (quality call, time-neutral) · RGB/U8x3.

**Compose + thumb — ✅ DONE (2026-06-13):**
- `src/preview.rs` — `make_preview_from_jpeg_bytes(&[u8]) -> Option<Vec<u8>>` (decode→resize→encode, all `?`-funnelled) + `pick_scaling_factor(src_dim, target)` (rule: smallest supported `M/8` with scaled edge ≥ target via `min_by_key`; **no reliance on factor-list order**; re-derives 3/8 for 6240→1920 from the real header long edge; `ScalingFactor::ONE` fallback for already-small sources) + **orientation-aware** `resize` (clamp long edge to 1920, scale short proportionally, assign 1920 to width/height by orientation).
- `src/lib.rs` — IFD1 thumb: `get_thumbnail(&Exif) -> Option<Vec<u8>>` reads `JPEGInterchangeFormat`/`JPEGInterchangeFormatLength` at `In::THUMBNAIL`, fallible slice `buf.get(offset..offset+len)?` → free standalone-JPEG `to_vec()` (~13 KB, zero transcode). EXIF reads refactored to **one open/one parse**: `read_exif_container(&PhotoAsset)` → `get_capture_time(&Exif)` + `get_thumbnail(&Exif)` via `extract_exif_data(&Exif) -> ExifAssetData {captured_at, thumbnail}` (single extension point); `enrich_assets` folded to one `filter_map` pass (container drops in-closure → bounded memory). `captured_at` moved under `exif_data`.
- Test: `enrich_assets_test_thumbnail_filled_successfully` asserts SOI `FF D8` / EOI `FF D9` + size band (proves a complete JPEG carved at correct boundaries).
- **Memory model (5000 frames):** thumbs ~65 MB resident · compressed previews ~0.75–2.4 GB (~1.5 GB typical, persist-to-disk per plan) · decoded RGBA **~47 GB** (never resident → virtualized grid + LRU texture cache; ~64× compressed→decoded blow-up is why tier 3 must be LRU).

**RAW-only IFD0 preview (step 3) — ✅ DONE (2026-06-13):**
- `src/preview.rs` — preview core generalized to `get_resized_from_jpeg_bytes(src, target_long_dim)` (decode→resize→encode); `make_preview_from_jpeg_bytes` (1920) / `make_thumbnail_from_jpeg_bytes` (512) are thin wrappers. Target now threads into `pick_scaling_factor` *and* `resize` (no hardcoded 1920); smaller targets get smaller scaled decode (512 ⇒ 1/8 ⇒ thumbnails cheaper than previews).
- `src/lib.rs` — `get_embedded_preview_from_tiff_like(&Exif) -> Option<Vec<u8>>`: IFD0 single-strip embedded JPEG via `StripOffsets`/`StripByteCounts` at `In::PRIMARY`, fallible `buf.get(..)?` slice → `to_vec`. Feeds the same `make_*` pipeline; RAW-only path converges, zero RAW decode. Test asserts SOI/EOI + 0.5–6 MB band.
- **Probe numbers (`IMG_1939.CR2`):** `buf().len()` = 36,599,837 B (whole file — kamadak-exif holds the entire CR2) · `StripByteCounts` = 2,039,424 B (single-strip full-res ~1.95 MB) · turbojpeg decoded it → 1920px output visually verified. → slice-from-`buf()` is the correct extraction (seek-read would re-read; file already resident); 36 MB/CR2 resident is bounded by step-4 read-permit tier (~1–2 alive).
- **Three preview tiers:** IFD1 160×120 placeholder → generated 512 grid thumb → generated 1920 loupe preview (also the streaming order).

**Remaining (next): step 4 — streaming ingest.** Designed in guide mode 2026-06-13 (see global-plan Phase 2 §"three read stages" + §"Streaming channel (two-pass)"). The card is the bottleneck → read as little/late as possible. **Three read stages** (a different axis from Phase 3's concurrency tiers):
- **Stage 1 — skeleton** (header-only, *seek machinery*, every asset): `DateTimeOriginal` → greyed target tree; 160×120 IFD1 thumb → instant grid placeholder. **Caches the IFD0 strip offset** it parses, so stage 2 needs no second header read.
- **Stage 2 — embedded seek** (assets *with a RAW*): `pread` only the embedded-JPEG strip (~2–3 MB) using the cached offset → 512 + 1920 previews. **Mandatory, not an optimization:** kamadak slurps the *whole* 36 MB CR2 for `buf()`; targeted `pread` = ~12× less I/O on the primary (RAW-only) path.
- **Stage 3 — full read + fan-out** (replication; every kept file): read whole file once → write all targets; **also previews JPEG-source assets** (the copy read tees into decode — not an extra scan).

**Preview-source by type:** RAW-only → stage 2 (only viable source); JPEG-only → stage 3 (full read = the replication read, fan out); pair → **measurement decides** (seek ~3 MB embedded, lower-quality/non-contiguous, vs sequential ~6 MB JPEG, higher-quality/readahead). Two subsystems: *preview* (stages 1+2/3, triage-latency) + *replication* (stage 3, copies everything, lends its read to JPEG previews).

**Two-pass stream:** `SkeletonReady { key, captured_at, thumb_jpeg/160, raw_strip_offset }` (pass A, sweep ALL assets first → tree+placeholders) → `PreviewReady { key, thumb_jpeg/512, preview_jpeg/1920 }` (pass B). Consumer owns the asset store (from `scan()`); engine stateless, messages carry deltas. `captured_at` moves to pass A (was in `ProcessedPreview`).

**Why embedded < standalone JPEG at same res:** harder-compressed throwaway (low quality factor, 4:2:0, coarse quant) — RAW is the master. Standalone `.JPG` is higher quality → prefer for 1:1 focus; only byte-count favours embedded.

**Next concrete step — the spike** (before serial baseline): on one frame each of {RAW-only CR2, JPEG-only, pair} measure **bytes read + wall time** for slurp-vs-seek (CR2) and sequential-JPEG-vs-seek-embedded (pair), find the header-prefix size that captures the IFD0 offset, and eyeball embedded 1:1 quality. Settles the pair decision + stage-1/2 fusion. Then build the serial baseline (one worker, one channel) before layering the two pools.

**Known open items from step 2:**
- Per-frame `Decompressor` (per-thread reuse = later optimization to measure).
- Bench iterates one image 999× (CPU throughput proxy); real two-tier read+CPU measurement deferred to the streaming step.
- Previews-to-disk (SQLite blob path) vs held-in-RAM — decided at step 4 (channel consumer).
- EXIF `Orientation` (portrait frames stored landscape + tag) — display-time handling, parked.
- Step-4 message contract — **RESOLVED 2026-06-13:** two-pass, **consumer owns the store**, engine stateless, messages carry deltas. `SkeletonReady {key, captured_at, thumb_jpeg/160, raw_strip_offset}` → `PreviewReady {key, thumb_jpeg/512, preview_jpeg/1920}`. `captured_at` belongs to pass A (skeleton), not the preview message.
- Step-4 **pair preview-source** — OPEN, resolved by spike: seek embedded (~3 MB) vs read standalone JPEG (~6 MB). Decided by measured bytes+time on a real card + embedded 1:1 quality eyeball.
- Step-4 build order: spike (3 read strategies on {RAW-only, JPEG-only, pair}) → serial `P_read=1/P_cpu=1` baseline (one worker, one `crossbeam-channel`) → layer the two pools.
- `get_embedded_preview_from_tiff_like` currently slices from kamadak's full `buf()` (36 MB resident). Step-4 stage 2 replaces this with targeted `pread` of the cached IFD0 strip offset (~3 MB). Multi-format extraction (NEF/ARW/RAF/DNG) → `rawler`/`libraw` later.
- Nothing committed yet — the workspace refactor (staged renames + new module files) awaits review/commit.

**Resolved (was open, now done):** repo junk cleanup (`test_thumb/` + `example.JPG` git-removed, benches repointed/`CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`, `.DS_Store` gitignored); `pub` visibility (crate boundary forced the audit → internals `pub(crate)`); `println!` removed; preview test repointed; CR2-only thumb marker added; `resize` threads `target_long_dim`; redundant casts dropped.
